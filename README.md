# Bank frontend for enny

In order to run this as a devcontainer, you need to build enny as a local container first.
Just clone github.com/emmanuel-nyberg/enny and run `docker build -t enny:latest .`
After that, start VSCode and run enny-bank as a devcontainer project.
You need to run the collect_all endpoint to seed your database the first time around.
